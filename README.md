This repo is used to develop code for downloading PV-GIS data from https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/.

The code was previously developed by Songmin for downloading data from PV-GIS.
But it was not well maintained. Now, we want to recycle it to download the PV-GIS data of all 401 NUTS3 regions in Germany,
including temperature, radiation (4 orientations), and PV generation.
